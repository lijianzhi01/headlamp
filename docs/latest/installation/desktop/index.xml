      <description>For Windows we provide a .setup.exe installer, so you need to download it from the releases page and follow its installation steps (after the installation, you should see Headlamp&amp;rsquo;s icon on your desktop).
Important: While running Headlamp, if Windows Defender prompts you about stopping the app because it&amp;rsquo;s from an unknown source, that happens because Headlamp&amp;rsquo;s Windows builds are not yet signed (we&amp;rsquo;re working on it). You can still run the app by choosing &amp;ldquo;Run Anyway&amp;rdquo;.</description>
