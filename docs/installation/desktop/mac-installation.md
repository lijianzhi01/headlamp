For Mac OS we provide a _.dmg_ file, so you need to download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/kinvolk/headlamp/releases)
and than follow the below steps :

1. Double click the downloaded file to make its content available (name will show up in the Finder sidebar), usually a window opens showing the content as well
